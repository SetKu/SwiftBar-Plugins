# SwiftBar-Plugins

Some simple plugins for the [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) scripting tool for macOS.

These plugins can serve as examples for how to create one. They are intended to be used to get access to quick utilities and information, such as the weather and status of the Dropbox client Maestral.
